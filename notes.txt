Playing with Measure for the first time at a real piano:

- Proper fingering is important. I wasn't playing with the right fingering, especially since I was distracted by the visuals.
- It is just very cool to see your notes on the screen for the first time, at all -- it makes you want to play on the piano to see what patterns you can make
- It's very hard to keep time purely from the visual of the line coming up to the circle. How can we do better?
